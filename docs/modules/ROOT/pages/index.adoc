= RuboCop RSpec Extra

RSpec-specific analysis for your projects, as an extension to
https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop[RuboCop].
A place where no one is officially employed, but where useful cops can gather.

RuboCop RSpec Extra follows the https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/versioning.html[RuboCop versioning guide].
In a nutshell, between major versions new cops are introduced in a special `pending` status.
That means that they won’t be run unless explicitly told otherwise.
RuboCop will warn on start that certain cops are neither explicitly enabled and disabled.
On a major version release, all `pending` cops are enabled.

== Project Goals


* Simplify the process of adopting new RSpec functionality
* A collection of cops who are not hired by RuboCop RSpec but are useful when writing test code in RSpec
